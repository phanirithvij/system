### TODO

- clarify Glossary (https://www.iuniverse.com/en/resources/publishing/parts-of-your-book)

Profiles are for future use when there are unnamed servers (cattle) instead of named nixosConfigurations (pets).

eg. https://github.com/nix-community/srvos

Ideally simple desktop, server profiles exist.

but they can be grouped into media-server, media-desktop etc.

media-server will come with preconfigured jellyfin etc.
media-desktop will come with preconfigured jellyfin-desktop (if it exists) etc.

one can import both.

these are like nixos/home-manager modules with conceptual relations.

home-manager profiles too!
