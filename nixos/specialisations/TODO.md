## TODO for specialisations

Move all DE specialisations into nixos modules,
so that I can enable a desktop configuration with a boolean instead!

Specialisations are only for systemd-profiles idea I had, and testing out desktop environments but once I am happy with a DE config move it to a nixos module and then remove the specialisation.

This allows me to save storage as well as time when doing nixos-rebuild.

UNRELATED:

maybe a TODO.md and README.md close to the folders, multiple files, makes sense.
