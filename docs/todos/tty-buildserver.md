Two profiles
specialisations are a good fit

tty:
all nox (no X) services work as usual
maybe even audio bluetooth etc.
can I listen to music in tty with bluetooth and ncmpcpp/mpv console?
reason: sometimes video watching consumes lifespan
a remote dashboard for monitoring stuff

buildserver:
only nix services should be enabled
reason: no memory and cpu wasted for anything else
tty ofcourse
if needed a remote dashboard for monitoring stuff
