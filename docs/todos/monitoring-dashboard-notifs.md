crashes of bg services eg. plex, jellyfin, qbittorrent-nox or something

- https://getchoo.com/blog/systemd-discord-notifier
  - pros: works perfectly
  - cons: discord, proprietary, unfree, unreliable
- any notification service on android cannot be foss
  - without affecting performance or making UX worse
  - gotify, ntfy.sh have a persistent notification
    - persistent notifications should not exist on android for anything other
      than media playback
    - especially NOT for notification delivery
    - same issue with element matrix notifications
- prefer telegram over discord
