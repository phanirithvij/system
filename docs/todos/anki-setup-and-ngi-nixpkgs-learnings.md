Now that I am somewhat depended upon, I need to stay uptodate on latest
happenings along with arcane techincal and contribution knowledge on nixpkgs and
ngi pkgs.

Tools to assist me with this

- anki
- some AI summarizer and anki format generator based on my input
- some tool to sort by significance of new features and deprecations
  - in ngi as well as nixpkgs

Topics to keep in mind

- modular services
  - novel but useful to know about
- nixpkgs modules best practices
- packaging best practices and notes
  - finalAttrs over rec
  - versioncheckhook vs testers.testversion
  - git dependencies prefetch and patching if unsupported
- nixpkgs contribution guidelines
