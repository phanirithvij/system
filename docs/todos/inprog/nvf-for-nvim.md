Need to use nvf for setting up neovim

for now I need proper workflow figured out first for

- nix
  - nil
  - go to definition inside nixpkgs
- go
- python
- javascript (ts, jsx, json, etc.)
- lua (lua engine is a good embeddable engine, so used across a few places)
- zig
- rust

- lsp
- telescope
- nvim-cmp ?
- treesitter
- undo-history
- tests
- breakpoints/debugging
- tmuxp workspaces

- learn keybinds
- adopt @eljamm's config somewhat
  - zellij replacing tmux
    - without zen mode toggle I can't use it, mandatory for me
  - lazygit with cli to get file history, some other crazy context aware things
  - maybe I can use jj to adopt the same ideas
- jj from @ju1m
