Need to use nvf for setting up neovim

for now I need proper workflow figured out first for

- go
- python
- javascript (ts, jsx, etc.)
- lua (lua engine is a good embeddable engine, so used across a few places)
- zig
- rust

i.e. lsp, fzf, tests, undo-history, breakpoints/debugging (?), tmuxp workspaces
