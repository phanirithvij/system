## what

os level vs flake managed

TBA pros and cons

pros

- flake feels superior, like can run in non-nixos
  - maybe can be made to run as part of nixos-containers
  - there was a nix profile manager or something which allows decoupling from the system config

cons

- more moving targets, and huge system images when sysm could work fine
