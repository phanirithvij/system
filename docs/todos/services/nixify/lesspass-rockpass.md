## What

novel idea, but there's lots of criticism

If you have a password manager already it becomes fairly useless.

And the single master password makes it work like a password manager, but without remembering username/email etc.

Maybe the whole world should just use magic links or email otps or just totps without any passwords or yubikeys webauthn etc.
